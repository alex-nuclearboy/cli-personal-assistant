# Personal Assistant Bot

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Personal Assistant" bot! This innovative bot is crafted to assist users in efficiently managing their contacts, notes and files using a natural language interface. 

This Personal Assistant bot is inspired by and based on the [team project from the Python Core course at GoIT](https://github.com/ArleKinG44/GOIT_Projekt_group_3). 
Significant modifications have been made to the application's code to enhance user information presentation. 
These modifications include improved display of user contacts, notes, and a detailed page outlining available commands. 
An abstract base class for user views has been defined, with specific implementations inheriting from this class. 
These implementations offer a console interface, facilitating easy changes to the way information is presented to users. This project extends and refines the original concept, demonstrating a commitment to developing practical and impactful Python-based software solutions.
